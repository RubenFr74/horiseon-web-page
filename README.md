# Horiseon Web Page Project

## About

This is just a small project for my coding course. We were to refactored the code to the best of our abilities while also adding comments.
This project is a great way to gage someone's familiarity with elemtns and sequencing, it was pretty challenging for me
and I will include screenshots of the code before and after refactoring.
